            <p>Thinking of assing some css to this website today. I'm a little nervous. I'm generally afraid of making mistakes but the faster you fail the faster you get better.</p>
            <p><strong>CS50 Scratch Project: Requirments Fufilled</strong></p>
            <p>I fufilled the requirements for the CS50 scratch project, but I'd like to clean up the code a bit and then eventually finish the game. However, for now, this will have to do. I might keep playing with it before I watch the next lecture this weekend. I'd like to. It would be nice to implement a scoring system and start and finish screen as well as a timer. Here it is right now!</p>
